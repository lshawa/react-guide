This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Props and state
    1. props  and state  are CORE concepts of React. Actually, only changes in props  and/ or state  trigger React to re-render your components and potentially update the DOM in the browser

    2. Props 
        - Allow you to pass data from a parent (wrapping) component to a child (embedded) component.
    3. State 
        - Whilst props allow you to pass data down the component tree (and hence trigger an UI update), state is used to change the component, well, state from within. Changes to state also trigger an UI update.

        - Only class-based components can define and use state . You can of course pass the state  down to functional components, but these then can't directly edit it.

        - Whenever state  changes, the component will re-render and reflect the new state. The difference to props  is, that this happens within one and the same component - you don't receive new data (props ) from outside!

## Update the DOM in two ways: 
    1. Using state 
    2. Using props
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
